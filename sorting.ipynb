    "Sorting is a very common algorithm; you may already be familiar with multiple ways to do it. It's a good introductory algorithm because the desired outcome is simple (and easily visualizable!) and it's relevant. There are a few obvious but inefficient ways to do it (e.g. find the smallest item in the original list by scanning the entire list, put that item as the first element of a new, sorted list; repeat until the original list is empty. This is $O(n)$ for each item, so $O(n^2)$ total). Merge sort is a well known and simple algorithm that performs asymptotically as well as possible for an algorithm that has to compare all items to sort them (that may sound like it means that _no_ sorting algorithm can do better. If you're interested, look up count sort and then radix sort to see a way around having to compare all items). A proof of this isn't _too_ difficult, but I won't go into any proofs here, although they're an important part of a foundation in algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is a divide and conquer (and combine) algorithm. It works by splitting the unsorted list in half repeatedly until a base case is reached of a list of one element. A one element list is always sorted, so now instead of an unsorted $n$ element list, we have $n$ sorted, 1-element lists. Next those lists are combined with each other, two at a time (to make 2-element lists then 4-element lists until an $n$ element list is reached). The key to merge sort is that when one combines two sorted lists, one doesn't have to compare all items of both lists to each other. Suppose we are sorting so that smaller items come first. We know the smallest item of the combined list will be the smaller of the first items of the two starting lists. As an example, if I have the lists $l1=[3,6,8,9]$ and $l2 = [1,2,5,7]$ then I only check l1[0] and l2[0] to find that the smallest item is 1. This can be removed and appended to the combined list, $l12=[1]$. Then we iterate until there are no items left in $l1$ or $l2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking advantage of the sortedness of the lists lets us combine two lists in linear time in their size (that is, if the two lists are length $n$, I'll have to use $O(n)$ time to combine them: each element I add to the combined list requires me to access the first element of each list ($O(1)$), compare them ($O(1)$), and then add the smaller one to the combined list ($O(1)$) (I don't actually have to remove the elements from the split lists when I add them to the combined lists; I can juse update an index of which item is to be considered next in that split list so that I don't add the same element twice. Updating the index is also $O(1)$ (access the old value, increment it, store it)). In total this is $O(1)$ per element added, and $2n$ elements will be added, so $O(n)$ overall for combining two sorted lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Words are not nearly so good at describing such an algorithm as a good picture is. [Here][visualization] is a nice visualization that should help. At the top you can select the type of sort you want to see. Compare merge sort with the others given. Make sure to take a look at count sort and then radix sort. They are simple enough that just from watching you may already understand the entire algorithm, yet it's rather amazing: they allow sorting some lists (where the items can be counted in a fashion like shown) in $O(n)$. I hope you are seeing how simple and elegant many incredibly useful algorithms are. When you've clicked the type of sort you want, you can click create in the bottom left to make a new list (or use the one already generated), and then click Sort and Go to watch. Their implementation of merge sort is iterative rather than recursive, but you should be able to follow it still. The boxes in the bottom right show pseudocode; only worry about it if it helps.\n",
