    "# Sample Project: 8-puzzle\n",
    "Note how in the BFS/DFS problems, we didn't need to have access to the entire graph. All we needed was a node to start from, a way to find the children of that node, and a way to determine if a node was a goal (sometimes there is a single goal node, but other times there may be multiple). Thus when we are solving many graph problems, we can build the parts of the graph that we need without necessarily pre-building and storing the entire graph in memory. We don't need a _graph_ so much as:\n",
    "* a starting state\n",
    "* a way to compute the children of a given state\n",
    "* a way to determine if a state is a goal (there may be multiple, acceptable goals in some problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "A great number of problems can be framed in the context of a search across a graph by defining these three elements. This is useful becomes graph problems are well-characterized and there are already many algorithms for working with them. This exercise gives a fun example of how we can frame a problem as a graph and solve it using search.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure what an 8-puzzle is, play one quickly [here][8-puzz]. This problem is much more open-ended and may take more time, but it's also (in my opinion) the most practical; in real-life, you're going to need to find a way to convert your own problems into something that an algorithm can solve. You'll often be using/adapting known algorithms, but much of the difficulty is often just framining the problem correctly. Write a function to solve an 8-puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints (not too much to say here; if you need more help, you can look at the solution code below)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You'll probably want to start by defining an 8-puzzle class; you already know search algorithms that you can use to solve this problem once you have the class working properly. From above, you know the three elements you need in such a class. From playing the game a little, it should be clear which states are reachable from a given one (i.e. one slide (one edge) can get you from a given position to which others? Those are the children of that position).\n",
    "* You need to find a way to store the configuration of the board and to tell what new configurations you can reach from it.\n",
    "* You'll probably want a decent string representation of your 8-puzzle class so that you can watch the steps of solving it for debugging.\n",
    "* As I don't know how you'll write your Puzzle class, you'll have to do your own testing for correctness; you can see what I tested at the end of the solution code. Essentially, I gave it a couple of puzzles to start with and checked that it computed the right paths (or found no solution if there was none; be aware that an 8-puzzle is not always solvable. There's a proof about what has to hold for any given state for it to be solvable; I use that because I was aware of it before I tried to code this up, but I don't think you need to).\n",
    "* If you want to compare with something (though my code hasn't been tested that thoroughly), I've written an example with my code below; you can change the Puzzle to be a simpler one that you're debugging on if needed\n",
