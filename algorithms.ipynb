    "This notebook takes a brief look at two important algorithmic problems: sorting and searching. There are a few important aspects to consider for any given algorithm: **time** (how long does the algorithm take to complete? We are usually looking at the _asymptotic_ runtime, which we'll go into soon), **space** (how much memory is required to run the algorithm?), and **conditions** (what has to hold for the algorithm to work?). Additionally, when defining a new algorithm, one will need to prove its **correctness** (that is, that it returns the right result and does so using the specified amount of time and space).\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a grounding for understanding the run-time of an algorithm, we'll first take a look at **Big O** notation and how to calculate runtime for a recursive function, which will be useful for sorting. Next we'll implement the merge sort algorithm which is simple but efficient. For search, we'll first look at searching for an element in a sorted list using binary search including a fun application. Next we'll look at search on graphs and transforming a problem so that it can be solved by a graph search.\n",

    "Do you know Big-O notation? If not, a basic understanding of that is important for comparing algorithms. It tells you the _asymptotic_ runtime of an algorithm (how the runtime behaves as the size of the input grows to infinity). A quick Google search should be informative if you need a refresher. Essentially, if $f_1 = O(f_2)$ then, for a large enough input size, $f_1$ runs at least as fast as $f_2$. One way to check this is to look at the ratio $lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} (f_1 / f_2)$. If the limit approaches $\\infty$, then the runtume of the top term dominates ($f_1$ is slower for large enough inputs) so $f_2 = O(f_1)$. If the limit approaches 0, then $f_1 = O(f_2)$. If it approaches a constant, then $f_1 = O(f_2)$ and $f_2 = O(f_1)$. (In this case, $f_1 = \\Theta(f_2)$). As an example:\n",

    "Sorting is a very common algorithm; you may already be familiar with multiple ways to do it. It's a good introductory algorithm because the desired outcome is simple (and easily visualizable!) and it's relevant. There are a few obvious but inefficient ways to do it (e.g. find the smallest item in the original list by scanning the entire list, put that item as the first element of a new, sorted list; repeat until the original list is empty. This is $O(n)$ for each item, so $O(n^2)$ total). Merge sort is a well known and simple algorithm that performs asymptotically as well as possible for an algorithm that has to compare all items to sort them (that may sound like it means that _no_ sorting algorithm can do better. If you're interested, look up count sort and then radix sort to see a way around having to compare all items). A proof of this isn't _too_ difficult, but I won't go into any proofs here, although they're an important part of a foundation in algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is a divide and conquer (and combine) algorithm. It works by splitting the unsorted list in half repeatedly until a base case is reached of a list of one element. A one element list is always sorted, so now instead of an unsorted $n$ element list, we have $n$ sorted, 1-element lists. Next those lists are combined with each other, two at a time (to make 2-element lists then 4-element lists until an $n$ element list is reached). The key to merge sort is that when one combines two sorted lists, one doesn't have to compare all items of both lists to each other. Suppose we are sorting so that smaller items come first. We know the smallest item of the combined list will be the smaller of the first items of the two starting lists. As an example, if I have the lists $l1=[3,6,8,9]$ and $l2 = [1,2,5,7]$ then I only check l1[0] and l2[0] to find that the smallest item is 1. This can be removed and appended to the combined list, $l12=[1]$. Then we iterate until there are no items left in $l1$ or $l2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking advantage of the sortedness of the lists lets us combine two lists in linear time in their size (that is, if the two lists are length $n$, I'll have to use $O(n)$ time to combine them: each element I add to the combined list requires me to access the first element of each list ($O(1)$), compare them ($O(1)$), and then add the smaller one to the combined list ($O(1)$) (I don't actually have to remove the elements from the split lists when I add them to the combined lists; I can juse update an index of which item is to be considered next in that split list so that I don't add the same element twice. Updating the index is also $O(1)$ (access the old value, increment it, store it)). In total this is $O(1)$ per element added, and $2n$ elements will be added, so $O(n)$ overall for combining two sorted lists.\n",

At the top you can select the type of sort you want to see. Compare merge sort with the others given. Make sure to take a look at count sort and then radix sort. They are simple enough that just from watching you may already understand the entire algorithm, yet it's rather amazing: they allow sorting some lists (where the items can be counted in a fashion like shown) in $O(n)$. I hope you are seeing how simple and elegant many incredibly useful algorithms are. When you've clicked the type of sort you want, you can click create in the bottom left to make a new list (or use the one already generated), and then click Sort and Go to watch. Their implementation of merge sort is iterative rather than recursive, but you should be able to follow it still. The boxes in the bottom right show pseudocode; only worry about it if it helps.\n",

An iterative implementation is almost certainly O(1) because it will only change the indices between which you are searching (see code below for iterative and recursive examples). A recursive implementation may copy a piece of the list (e.g. the first half) to search on next. In Python, slicing a list (e.g. l[:(n / 2)]) copies the _references_ to the elements but not the elements themselves (the reference tells you where in memory the element is located). This is quicker and uses less memory than copying the list elements, but it still means recursing on a slice is not O(1) each time. However, we should look at how much time this copying takes overall: the first time, we copy $n/2$ references, then $n/4$, etc. This means the total number of operations for copying is\n",

    "\n",
    "This will be too slow asymptotically. There are ways to avoid this: what we want is a _view_ of the list: something which shares the exact same memory as the original list so that nothing has to be copied. Python lists don't allow this that I'm aware of, but the NumPy library's arrays do; their slices are views. The timing tests I wrote use NumPy arrays, so the recursive implementation takes O(1) time to generate a half-size view of the array and recurse (the solution functions work for Python lists as well, but they're slower).\n",

They say that the amulet was imbued with algorithmic energy, and its owner had the ability to solve any problem with a polynomial time algorithm. However, many thought this power was too great, and the amulet was cursed by an ancient spirit. The amulet was taken, and hidden away somewhere in one of an inﬁnite series of treasure chests. Many young algorithms students and treasure hunters have tried to ﬁnd the amulet, but all have failed.\n",

Cautious yet brave, you approach to ﬁnd the ghostly spirit of a 6.006 teaching assistant from yearspast. \"Yooooou...\" he wails out in his ghostly tenor. \"Yoooou can ﬁnd the amuuuleeet!\" He fades away into the darkness, and as you stand there questioning your sanity, you see a small package on the ground where the ghost had been. You inspect the package and ﬁnd that it contains a magic map. A map that can lead you to the Amulet of Rivest. The map doesn’t give out the answer; it can only tell you if the amulet exists within a specified integer range of chests. The map’s ghostly nature also makes it unstable. If used too many times, it will cease to exist in our mortal plane. You are nonetheless conﬁdent that you can use your algorithms knowledge to ﬁnd the amulet and achieve ultimate glory!\n",

    "The infinite series of chests is indexed by the positive integers. You need to implement the `find_amulet` function, which takes a single parameter $magic_map$, the magic map function. Your find amulet function should return the index $n$ of the chest containing the amulet. The magic map function simulates your magic map. Calling `magic_map(a,b)` will return `True` if and only if the amulet is in the range $[a,b)$.\n",
    "Note that Python integers may be arbitrarily large, and that float('inf') is the Python2.7 way of writing \"inﬁnity\". It looks like a ﬂoating-point number but can be compared to any integer. Note, this means that `magic_map(1, float('inf'))` will always return `True`, and `magic_map(a, a+1)` will return `True` if and only if the amulet is in chest $a$.\n",

    "Graphs are very useful because many problems can be transformed into a graphical representation such that a known algorithm can give you a solution. One common problem, given a graph, is finding the best path between two nodes. There are a variety of algorithms for this problem depending on your definition of 'best' path and the sort of graph you have. Graphs come in a variety of flavors. Here we'll deal with _directed_ graphs (A->B does not imply B->A) with _unweighted_ edges (the length of a path is just the number of edges in it; equivalently, these could be weighted graphs where all edges have the same edge weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-first search (BFS) prioritizes search near the source, spreading out slowly but searching all paths as it goes. It is _breadth_-first in the sense that it searches all nodes at a given depth from the source (e.g. two edges away) first before moving deeper (e.g. to nodes three edges away). Depth-first search (DFS) differs in that it searches deeper nodes first until there are no deeper nodes, then it moves up as little as possible to find a new path to move deeper on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch a visualization of BFS/DFS [here][visual]. Just skip through the intro explanation of the tool unless you're interested. Then you can draw any graph you like by clicking \"Draw Graph\" in the orange menu on the left side (or have it generate a random graph for you). Once you have a nice graph, click either BFS or DFS to watch the algorithms go (you just have to enter the start node; it doesn't take a goal node as an input but rather keeps searching until it has searched the entire graph to find the shortest paths from the source to all nodes. You can see how long it would have taken to find a given node, though, as you watch). If it moves too fast, you can pause the visualization (the controls are at the bottom of the screen) and use the forward/backward arrow keys to advance. You can also use +/- to change the speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path between the source and any other node (because it prioritizes shorter paths). DFS does not have this guarantee; as it searches longer paths first, it may find a sub-optimal path. However, both are guaranteed to find some path if a path exists. You might expect that DFS would be quicker then, but the runtime for both is $O(V + E)$ where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $E$ is the number of edges (DFS _is_ useful for some things, though; it is used, for example, when doing topological sorts).\n",

    "I've written some code for a Node class below; you can use it if you want, adapt it, or write your own. There is also a Graph class (though you could just use a list) and a function that should help in specifying graphs. If you use the Node class below, all you need is the starting node (and to have the goal specified) in order to do your search. I wrote a little code that shows how to make a graph, set the goal node, and find a path using this code.\n",

    "* One generally stores a graph as either an adjacency matrix or an edge list.\n",
    "    * An adjacency matrix $A$ is a square $n x n$ matrix, where $n$ is the number of nodes, which has $a_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, otherwise the entries are 0. One can do a large number of useful things with adjacency matrices. For example, from the definition you already know that $A^1$ gives the number of paths of length 1 or less between pairs of nodes; this property actually holds for any power as well. That is, the entries of $A^k$ are the number of paths of length $k$ or less between the given pairs of nodes. \n",
    "    * An edge list has elements that are tuples of nodes. If there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ then there will be an element $i,j$ in the edge list.\n",
    "* There are a number of different _centralities_ that one can compute on graphs. These tell you which nodes are most important, for varying definitions of importance. The simplest is degree centrality: each node's degree centrality is just the same as its degree (the degree of a node is the number of edges it has; for directed graphs, one also delineates in-degree and out-degree for the number of in- and out-edges of a node).\n",

    "   * However, in practice, sometimes you can gain a bit of a speedup by using a structure that is optimized for your definition of priority instead of one that sorts each element added by your priority definition. You can decide when implementing if it is better to make your function more adaptable or more efficient. That is, a priority queue keeps all elements sorted by a defined priority that each element has. However, instead you can just use a Queue for BFS because it also keeps things in priority-order for BFS (the priority value of each item is just implicit). For DFS, you can use a **Stack** instead of a Queue: think of a stack of books. The first ones you take off are the last ones you added. This means you remove the nodes most recently put on the fringe. For example, if the starting node has three children, those will go to the bottom of the stack. When you expand the top one, its children are added to the top, so you visit those before going back to the two remaining children of the starting node.\n",

    "To show how similar BFS and DFS are, I wrote a solution function that can do either algorithm with only a very minor change. To write an even more general function, you need to have some aspect of a node that you can use to compute the priorities (e.g. for BFS/DFS, add the distance from the start node and then you can compute the priorities). Then you can use a priority queue that will keep your nodes in the right order for whatever sort of priority you define."

    "There are many other graph search algorithms. A\\* is a well-known one that uses heuristics to try to speed up search (though the asymptotic runtime is the same, a good heuristic can be very powerful). For graphs with weighted edges, Dijkstra's algorithm is generally the go-to. It requires that there be no negative-weight edges, however. If there are, use Bellman-Ford. If the edge weights are small, positive integers, you can also transform a weighted graph into an unweighted one by inserting dummy nodes (e.g. A-3->B becomes A->d->d->B where d is a dummy node and 3 is the initial weight of the edge) and then use BFS. None of these algorithms should be too difficult to understand at this point.\n",

Depending on the setting, there may be a different algorithm you want (e.g. Floyd-Warshall is better than doing Bellman-Ford from each vertex). However, some algorithms are the best regardless of the setting (e.g. BFS can't be beat by any known algorithm if you just want SSSP even though it actually computes APSP in $O(V + E)$).  "
